If it is possible to detect the position of stars as well as knowing the
current time, it is possible to detect geographic location.

This calculation uses pitch, roll, and possibly yaw (depending on how the
inferometer is aligned) to scan for stars.  The star view should be aligned
with 2 stars, however, a third is required to eliminate the last two
orientations unless the magnetometer aids the calculation.  Depending on the
precision of the data, more stars may be needed to get a "fix"

It may be possible to track time by measuring earth and moon gravitational
changes as well (requires at least 20-bit accelerometer data to track the
moon).  It is possible to also calculate roughly the position in the sky
of the body.
