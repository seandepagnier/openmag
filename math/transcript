For the ellipse in the form

x = r*cos(t)
y = s*sin(t-u)

the maximum x and y values are determined by r and s.
That is, the maximum value of the y coordinate will
be |s| and that of the x coordinate will be |r|.

You can determine the maximum value of the y coordinate
from the second form of the ellipse by solving for y in
terms of x (you'll get two equations, one for each of
the positive and negative roots), and finding the
inflection points as usual: differentiate, set to zero,
solve for variable.  Expressing x in terms of y and
repeating the method will similarly yield an expression
for the maximum x value.

Using this method, for positive r and s I came up with

r = 2*sqrt(c/(4ac - b^2)
s = 2*sqrt(a/(4ac - b^2)

The maximum x value (that is, r) occurs when cos(t) = 1.
This will happen when t = 0.  When t = 0 we also have
y = s*sin(-u).  Solve ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 = 1 for y
when x = r (the maximum x-value) and equate.  I found

u = arcsin(b/(2*sqrt(ac))
