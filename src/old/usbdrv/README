USB support for Atmels AT90USB (1287) microcontroller
Firmware is compatible with avr-gcc version 3.4.6 and 4.1.2 
Enumeration (with Linux host) and basic data transfer (LibUSB 0.1.12) works fine now!
A simple example program for Linux console is included.
Basic documentation is available on my homepage, see http://www.ssalewski.de/Misc.html
