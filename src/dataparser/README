the dataparser program can operate in compilation or link mode.

In compilation mode, there are no arguments, input is a preprocessed file read
from stdin, output is the generated code output to stdout.  The generated code
is not yet ready to be compiled, but must be linked using dataparser.  To
combine multiple generated files into a library, simple concatination is
allowed.

In link mode the arguments are one or more files to combine, the final output
is always datagen.c and datagen.h which can be compiled by the main program
