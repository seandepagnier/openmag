This is a nonblocking lcd driver for HD44780 lcds
Copyright (C) 2007 Sean D'Epagnier <sean@depagnier.com>

There is a blocking version (lcd-blocking.h) included which uses
less ram, and program space, and doesn't require lcd_poll to be called.

Typically lcd.h is included by one file which defines various
constants to configure the lcd eg:

#define LCDDBPORT PORTA
#define LCDDBPIN PINA
#define LCDDBDDR DDRA
#define LCDDBMASK 0xf0
#define LCDDBSHIFT 4            /* how many bits left to shift
                                ** a DB nibble to get it to line up */
#define LCDRPORT PORTC
#define LCDRDDR DDRC
#define LCDR (_BV(PC5))

#define LCDRSPORT PORTC
#define LCDRSDDR DDRC
#define LCDRS (_BV(PC4))

#define LCDEPORT PORTA
#define LCDEDDR DDRA
#define LCDE (_BV(PA3))

#define LCD_NUM_COLS 20
#include <lcd/lcd.h>
#include <lcd/lcdprintf.h>

lcdprintf.h may be included in any files that want to use lcd_printf or
lcd_setLine.

It is possible to call lcd_printf([row], [col], fmt, ...)
to display text on the lcd.  This call does not ever block.
Instead, lcd_poll(); must be called periodically at no faster
rate than the lcd can handle.  Each time lcd_poll is called it attempts
to perform the next step toward updating the display without blocking.
It is common to place lcd_poll in a timer interrupt.
