MyUSB is a usb driver for AT90USB microcontrollers written by Dean Camera.

The complete distribution is in the MyUSB directory.  To update the distribution, just replace the MyUSB directory with the zip file provided by Dean Camera (http://fourwalledcubicle.com/files/MyUSB.zip)

The Makefile in the current directory builds MyUSB as a library to be used with openmag.

Note: If you have errors building the library, first try "make clean" in the MyUSB directory.
