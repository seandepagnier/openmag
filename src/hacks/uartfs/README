Adds support for fopen, fclose, fseek, ftell, and rewind to avr-libc.

A connection from the uart of the device to a pc must be made, and the program
uart-host is run on the pc (compile with "make host")
"uart-host -d /dev/ttyS0 -b 300" will use ttyS0 at 300 baud.

Right now the makefile is set for an atmega 164p with parallel port programmer.
It should be modified for your needs.  The uart registers are also set to the
first uart on this device (it has 2)  They may need to be modified for devices
with only one uart, or to use the second uart instead.

All actions are redirected from the program on the device to the host program,
so files will be created on the host system relative to the location the host
program is run.

At startup, uartfs_init must be called with a baud rate.  This automatically
opens stdin, stdout, and stderr for use.  (see demo.c)

NOTE: Writing from the device to the pc is much faster than reading, to avoid
buffering on the device, a read command byte is sent for each byte read.

To reduce ram usage, by default only 10 streams can be opened at a time.  This
number can be easily modified (see uart.c line 9)
